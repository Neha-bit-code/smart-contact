# Smart-contact
# Project Title
 Write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.
# Description
require():
Used to validate conditions that should hold true before executing a function.
If the condition is false, it reverts the transaction and optionally provides an error message.

assert():
Used to test for conditions that should never be false.
Typically used for internal errors and to check invariants.


revert():
Directly reverts the transaction and optionally provides an error message.
Useful for complex conditions and to provide detailed error messages within nested conditions or loops.
